SOME HELP..

If you don't know the set of a card you can provide the attacks the card has.
Say for example you have some old pokemon cards lying around, 
you can provide attacks or possibly other text that is on the card which could identify it.
I have an old Ponyta and it has Ember.
# 1x Ponyta with Ember
(that would hopefully identify it)
In this case it doesn't so I would have to include the card number as well.
# 1x Ponyta 64 with Ember
