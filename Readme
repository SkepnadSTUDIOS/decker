Decker!
---------
A tool for creating trading card decks for Table Top Simulator.

At the moment, it only supports magic and pokemon decks.
Have a look at the provided example decks on how to format a deck.

To install on linux, ensure you have go installed and run.
$ sudo apt-get install golang imagemagick
$ make && sudo make install

For windows, run: (Not tested)
$ go build -o ./decker.exe ./src
You also need the imagemagick program 'montage' installed.

Some example decks are contained in the decks folder.
Have a look at those if you are confused to how a deck file should look like.

$ cd ./decks/magic
$ decker *.deck
$ cd ./decks/pokemon
$ decker *.deck
    
This will generate the decks into images in the respective folder.
    
Usage:
$ decker -o deck.jpg deck.txt

This will generate an image called deck.jpg.
Put this image somewhere online and it can be downloaded by Table Top Simulator!
